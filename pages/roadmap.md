## **Why This Portfolio Exists**
My trusty and visually appealing PDF portfolio felt out of date and I thought this would be a great opportunity to update my portfolio while also learning a new skill.

I decided to **learn Jekyll** and build this portfolio as a way to **showcase my technical skills alongside my Product Management accomplishments**. 

This portfolio is more than just a **collection of case studies**—it's a **product** that I plan to **develop and maintain over time**; new case studies will be added, and technical improvements will be made to enhance usability and engagement. Below, you'll find a **roadmap** of features that have already been completed and what's planned for the future.
