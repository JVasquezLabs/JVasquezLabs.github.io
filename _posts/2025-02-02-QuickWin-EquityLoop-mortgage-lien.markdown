## **🚨 The Problem**  
### **Incorrect Responses to Mortgage & Lien Question**  
A critical step in the loan application process asked homeowners:  

> _"Do you have any mortgages or liens on your home?"_  

However, many applicants misunderstood the term **lien**—associating it only with negative financial situations—without realizing that a **mortgage itself is a lien**.  

### **Why Was This a Big Deal?**  
- **20% of loan applications with mortgages** had incorrect responses.  
- Incorrect responses **skipped an automated request** for mortgage-related documents.  
- This led to **manual intervention from sales**, **delayed loan estimates**, and **added friction** to the customer experience.

## **💡 The Solution: A Simple UI & Copy Fix**  
We tested two iterations to refine the mortgage question:  

### ✅ **Experiment 1: Rewording the Question**  
- Adjusted the language to clarify that a mortgage is a lien.  
- **Result:** Increased confusion and increased errors.  

### ✅ **Experiment 2: Changing the UX Flow**  
- **Instead of asking a yes/no question,** we directly asked:  
  > "What is your outstanding mortgage balance?"  
- Added a **checkbox**: "_I don’t have a mortgage._"  
- If a value was entered (i.e., they had a mortgage), the next page **listed all possible lien types**, asking homeowners to select any that applied.  
- **Result:** Incorrect responses dropped from **20% to just 5%.**

## **🎯 Key Takeaways**  

📌 **Strategic UX changes can unlock massive operational efficiencies.**  
Even a small tweak in how information is collected can eliminate unnecessary manual work, **reduce processing delays**, and **improve customer satisfaction**—all without requiring a major engineering overhaul.  

📌 **Precision in question framing is critical for accurate data collection.**  
The way a question is worded can dramatically affect user responses. By **removing ambiguity** and structuring inputs logically, we ensured that applicants provided accurate information upfront, leading to **more reliable loan estimates and smoother automated workflows**.  

📌 **A/B testing is essential for uncovering the best solution with minimal risk.**  
Rather than making assumptions, we conducted **rapid, iterative testing** to validate what actually worked. This **data-driven approach** allowed us to pinpoint the most effective fix while minimizing unintended consequences.
