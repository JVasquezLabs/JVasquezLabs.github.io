<p>MegaLoans is a digital mortgage lender focused on <strong>streamlining home loans</strong> through technology and automation. During the <strong>2020/21 refinance boom</strong>, the company faced a critical challenge: <strong>appraisal delays were increasing operational costs and reducing profitability</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Issue:</strong> The appraisal process suffered from inefficiencies that triggered <strong>frequent rate lock extensions</strong>, forcing MegaLoans to <strong>honor lower interest rates</strong>, despite market fluctuations.</p>

<h2 id="-the-problem-rate-lock-extensions-were-costing-millions"><strong>🚨 The Problem: Rate Lock Extensions Were Costing Millions</strong></h2>
