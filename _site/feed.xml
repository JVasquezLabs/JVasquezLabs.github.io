Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="-overview"><strong>🔹 Overview</strong></h2>
<p>🚀 <strong>Challenge:</strong> Appraisal delays led to <strong>rate lock extensions</strong>, increased costs, and <strong>lost revenue</strong>.<br />
📈 <strong>Solution:</strong> Automated scheduling, real-time tracking, and vendor optimization.<br />
🏆 <strong>Results:</strong> Reduced time to close by <strong>4 days</strong>, cut internal effort by <strong>15%</strong>, and <strong>improved customer satisfaction</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-background"><strong>📍 Background</strong></h2>
<p>MegaLoans is a digital mortgage lender focused on <strong>streamlining home loans</strong> through technology and automation. During the <strong>2020/21 refinance boom</strong>, the company faced a critical challenge: <strong>appraisal delays were increasing operational costs and reducing profitability</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Issue:</strong> The appraisal process suffered from inefficiencies that triggered <strong>frequent rate lock extensions</strong>, forcing MegaLoans to <strong>honor lower interest rates</strong>, despite market fluctuations.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-the-problem-rate-lock-extensions-were-costing-millions"><strong>🚨 The Problem: Rate Lock Extensions Were Costing Millions</strong></h2>
<p>The mortgage industry saw a <strong>surge in refinancing applications</strong> due to historically low interest rates. However, <strong>bottlenecks in the appraisal process</strong> created significant delays.</p>

<h3 id="-business-impact"><strong>🔻 Business Impact</strong></h3>
<p>❌ <strong>Revenue Loss</strong>: Rate lock extensions shrank MegaLoans’ profit margins.<br />
❌ <strong>Operational Bottlenecks</strong>: Underwriters and loan processors spent excessive time chasing appraisals.<br />
❌ <strong>Customer Frustration</strong>: Extended closing times led to increased complaints and drop-offs.</p>

<p><strong>To address these issues, I led a cross-functional initiative to optimize the appraisal workflow.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-solution-a-data-driven-approach"><strong>📊 Solution: A Data-Driven Approach</strong></h2>
<p>To resolve appraisal inefficiencies, I implemented a <strong>three-phase strategy:</strong></p>

<h3 id="1️⃣-diagnosing-the-problem"><strong>1️⃣ Diagnosing the Problem</strong></h3>
<p>📌 Conducted stakeholder interviews with <strong>loan officers, underwriters, and operations teams</strong> to map the <strong>end-to-end appraisal process</strong>.<br />
📌 Identified <strong>key bottlenecks</strong>, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Manual scheduling inefficiencies</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Lack of real-time tracking for appraisal status</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Unpredictable turnaround times from third-party vendors</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2️⃣-designing-the-strategy"><strong>2️⃣ Designing the Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>✅ <strong>Vendor Evaluation</strong> – Assessed multiple <strong>appraisal management platforms</strong> to determine the best integration.<br />
✅ <strong>Workflow Automation</strong> – Partnered with engineering to implement <strong>automated scheduling &amp; tracking</strong>.<br />
✅ <strong>Data-Driven Optimization</strong> – Established <strong>tracking metrics</strong> to monitor <strong>appraisal turnaround times</strong> and select high-performing vendors.<br />
✅ <strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong> – Ensured changes aligned with <strong>mortgage industry regulations</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="3️⃣-execution--implementation"><strong>3️⃣ Execution &amp; Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>🚀 <strong>Delivered Key Upgrades:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automated Appraisal Scheduling</strong> → Eliminated manual coordination, accelerating the process.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Tracking Dashboard</strong> → Provided instant visibility into appraisal status for loan officers.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendor SLAs &amp; A/B Testing</strong> → Negotiated agreements with vendors for <strong>faster &amp; more predictable</strong> turnaround times.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-key-learnings"><strong>🔑 Key Learnings</strong></h2>
<p>📌 <strong>Automating repetitive processes</strong> leads to massive efficiency gains.<br />
📌 <strong>Real-time tracking &amp; visibility</strong> improves operational alignment.<br />
📌 <strong>Vendor partnerships require active management</strong> to maintain <strong>consistent SLAs</strong>.<br />
